# Air Quality Sensor library

This library implements support for two air quality sensors, the PMSA003i and
the SGP30 for use with the periph.io hardware library.


## PMSA003i

The PMSA003i is a digital particle concentration sensor which can be used to
obtain the number of suspended particles in the air. You can purchase the
sensor from a variety of places, including [AdaFruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4632).

The datasheet can be [found here](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/4632/4505_PMSA003I_series_data_manual_English_V2.6.pdf).


## SGP30

The SGP30 is a gas sensor that can measure CO<sub>2</sub> and Total Volatile
Organic Compunds (TVOC) in the air. You can purchase the sensor from the usual
places, including from [AdaFruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3709).
